# Credit Risk Analysis
## Overview
In this module we used supervised machine learning to evaluate credit risk.
## Results
There were six models used to analyze this data. These models delivered mixed results. 
- The first model used a Random Over Sampler with Logistic Regression. The accuracy of this model was about 60.2%.
